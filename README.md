Linkedin-graph
==============

This repository consists of code for a project that aims to map out the career roadmaps of Linkedin connections.  The objective is to develop a web application that will allow users to pick a job / title / position within a specific orgnization or industry, and be able to statistically show what the most common route to get to that position is.  The tool will enable users to plan our their career roadmaps by picking orgnizations, function roles, and job titles as they move through their careers.  

To date, I have used the following tools to develop this web application:

1.  Python
2.  R
3.  Javascript
4.  HTML
