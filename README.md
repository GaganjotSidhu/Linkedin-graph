Linkedin-graph
==============

This repository consists of code for a project that aims to map out the education and career roadmaps of Linkedin connections.  The objective is to develop a web application that will allow users to pick a job / title / position within a specific orgnization or industry, and be able to statistically show what the most common route to get to that position is.  The tool will enable users to plan our their career roadmaps by picking orgnizations, function roles, and job titles as they move through their careers.  

For example, if you are an undergraduate and would like to be VP of Marketing at Google in 10 years, this tool will help you understand how VP's at Google and other related companies got to that specifc role.  It will outline the fields of study, asn well as all the job titles that they have had along the way.  The tool can be used by career services or individuals.

To date, I have used the following tools to develop this web application:

1.  Python
2.  R
3.  Javascript
4.  HTML
